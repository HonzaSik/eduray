    Fractal Brownian Motion (FBM) noise texture. Combines multiple octaves of Perlin noise to create more complex, natural-looking patterns.
     - base: The base noise function to use (default is Perlin noise)
     - octaves: Number of noise layers to combine
     - lacunarity: Frequency multiplier for each octave (default 2.0 means each octave has double the frequency of the previous one)
     - gain: Amplitude multiplier for each octave (default 0.5 means each octave has half the amplitude of the previous one)
     The final noise value is a weighted sum of the octaves, normalized to roughly [-1, 1] and then scaled by the strength property from the Noise base class.
