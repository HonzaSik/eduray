        Cast a ray into the scene and compute the resulting color. This method should be implemented by subclasses to define specific ray tracing behavior. In a recursive integrator, this method will typically call itself recursively to handle reflections, refractions, and other effects that require multiple ray bounces.

        :param depth: The current recursion depth, which can be used to limit how many times the ray can bounce. If None, it should use a default maximum depth defined in the integrator.
